# HackOff

# The Coconut:
As coconuts are tough to open so are your files in our portal.

# Our Vision
Cyber Attacks are increasing on a daily basis and so are the various methods employed by the hackers, compromising the privacy of people across the internet. And with newer data security regulations arising from the governments across the globe, this presents a need for a secure environment where data can be stored away from prying eyes, anonymously. 

We believe privacy is a fundamental right to human beings, and a place where privacy is upheld was needed in today's Dystopian world which is fast becoming a single metropolis at ‘World Wide Web’. This has led us to create ‘The Coconut’, a platform where we hope a resemblance of the utopian world is visible. A single place where privacy is the only hallmark.

With this vision, we are on mission to make sure your data needs are met. No one including us can infringe upon the privacy of your data. 

### Encryption: 
We have used the state of the art Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), to encrypt your files providing you with the best possible solution to your data security needs.

### Hashing: 
The importance of hashing cannot be underestimated. With argon2 as our hashing algorithm we are providing you with the one of the best if not the best industry standard in hashing. Winner of PHC, argon2 is in its own league.

### Blockchain: 
Introducing ‘Coconuts’, with a distinct, trustless system it gives the utopian solution in storage of data. Providing you with the ideal, making your data tamper and expunge proof.


# What is the novelty in our Project?
To store files, we could use a general folder and organize it well. But in our project, we have used blockchain to store all the files required and the innovation in our project is that we did the encryption of the data in the files rather than the files. Encryption is done using AES and key generation is done by ARGON2 hashing. So we not just store various kinds of files but also store it securely.

# What and How we implemented?
We implemented a portal for the people to facilitate them in storage of any kind of Confidential Data. We have used HTML, CSS, Javascript, Django, AES Algorithm, ARGON2, Optical Character Recognition(OCR) for building the portal,encryption of data and their features. Along with them we used Python for building up the Optical Character Recognition which has been a way to encrypt the data in particular kind of files like PDFs and Pictures.We did the encryption of the data in the files using the AES Algorithm via Hashing and generating a key using ARGON2 that was the winner in The Password Hashing Competition(PHC) First and then storing it. To retrieve the same file we use Salt and IV (Initialisation Vector) with the user input password to generate a key.The key is no manner is stored anywhere across the platform. The Files that we can encrypt can be text files and scanned documents.

# Technology Stack used :
Encryption - AES

Hashing - ARGON2

Blockchain 

Optical Character Recognition - Python

Front End - HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap 

Backend - Django 
 
# What challenges did we face?
We went through various challenges. The firstmost was storing binary data in a block of blockchain and the other challenge was finding out the industry standards in cryptography to make sure that the data of the user is not compromised in any way. We were able to achieve this after a rigorous search and talking to the mentors as well. After gaining all the necessary knowledge we were able to overcome the challenge.We faced hardware complexity in making sure the time taken by the feature(Optical Character Recognition)  does not exceed the limits while reading the content of the file.
 
# What did we learn?
We learnt a lot of things like Encrypting , Hashing and Decrypting of the data in the files. We learnt how to use Blockchain technology to store files. We learnt building up a Optical Character recognition model which eventually got us to help read data from various kinds of files like PDFs or Pictures . We got exposure to many new technologies, along with, we learnt how to deal with building up something together in a given time period. We also learnt the need of Information Security in today’s world.
