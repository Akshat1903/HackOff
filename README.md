# Our Vision
Cyber Attacks are increasing on a daily basis and so are the various methods employed by the hackers, compromising the privacy of people across the internet. And with newer data security regulations arising from the governments across the globe, this presents a need for a secure environment where data can be stored away from prying eyes, anonymously. 

We believe privacy is a fundamental right to human beings, and a place where privacy is upheld was needed in today's Dystopian world which is fast becoming a single metropolis at ‘World Wide Web’. This has led us to create ‘The Coconut’, a platform where we hope a resemblance of the utopian world is visible. A single place where privacy is the only hallmark.

With this vision, we are on mission to make sure your data needs are met. No one including us can infringe upon the privacy of your data. 

### Encryption: 
We have used the state of the art Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), to encrypt your files providing you with the best possible solution to your data security needs.

### Hashing: 
The importance of hashing cannot be underestimated. With argon2 as our hashing algorithm we are providing you with the one of the best if not the best industry standard in hashing. Winner of PHC, argon2 is in its own league.

### Blockchain: 
Introducing ‘Coconuts’, with a distinct, trustless system it gives the utopian solution in storage of data. Providing you with the ideal, making your data tamper and expunge proof.


# What is the novelty in our Project?
To store files ,We could use a general folder and organize it well. But in our Project , We used Blockchain to store all the files required and the innovation in our Project is that We did the encryption of the data in the files rather than the files. We did it via Hashing using ARGON2 which was the winner in The Password Hashing Competition(PHC). So we not just store various kinds of files but also store it securely.

# What and How we implemented?
We implemented a portal for the people to facilitate them in storage of any kind of Confidential Data. We have used HTML, CSS ,Javascript, Django,AES Algorithm,ARGON2 for building the portal,encryption of data and their features . Along with them we used Python for building up the Optical Character Recognition which has been a way to encrypt the data in particular kind of files like PDFs and Pictures.We did the encryption of the data in the files using the AES Algorithm via Hashing and generating a key using ARGON2 that was the winner in The Password Hashing Competition(PHC) First and then storing it. To retrieve the same file we use Decryption of the Hash Code (the Key generated during the encryption). The Files that we can encrypt can be text files, PDF Files, Excel Files of Pictures. 

# Technology Stack used :
Encryption - AES
Hashing - ARGON2
Blockchain 
Optical Character Recognition - Python
Front End - HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap 
Backend - Django 
 
# What challenges did we face?
We went through various challenges. The firstmost was storing binary data in a block of blockchain and the other challenge was finding out the industry standards in cryptography to make sure that the data of the user is not compromised in any way. We were able to achieve this after a rigorous search and talking to the mentors as well. After gaining all the necessary knowledge we were able to overcome the challenge.We faced hardware complexity in making sure the time taken by the feature(Optical Character Recognition)  does not exceed the limits while reading the content of the file.
 
# What did we learn?
We learnt a lot of things like Encrypting , Hashing and Decrypting of the data in the files. We learnt how to use Blockchain technology to store files. We learnt building up a Optical Character recognition model which eventually got us to help read data from various kinds of files like PDFs or Pictures . We got exposure to many new technologies, along with, we learnt how to deal with building up something together in a given time period. We also learnt the need of Information Security in today’s world.
